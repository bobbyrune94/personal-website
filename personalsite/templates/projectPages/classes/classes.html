		<h2>Classes</h2>
		<p>I've had the chance to work on some semester-long projects for certain classes to apply the concepts that we learned. Take a look at some of the projects I've worked on below.</p>
		<div class="Projects-classGroup">
			<h4>Traffic Volume Prediction Model</h4>
			<h6>For CS 4501 Machine Learning</h6>
			<p>This class taught us some basic machine learning algorithms and the theory behind them. We would also learn how to implement and use such algorithms to create models for specific data sets such as housing data and email spam data.</p>
			<p>This was our semester-long project where we used our knowledge of the algorithms we learned to gain some insight or solve a problem related to Virginia. Since our group all grew up in the Northern Virginia area, we decided to address the issue of traffic and road conditions. We wanted to see how potentially adverse conditions could impact the flow of traffic on a road.</p>
			<p>My work was primarily training the models using the data that my groupmates cleaned and combined. We used some simple algorithms such as Linear Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and Random Forest Regression because some of our data was categorical, which restricted some algorithms we could use. After training, I ran the models on the test sets and recorded the difference measures. I also wrote much of the report as I was waiting for my groupmates to clean the data. </p>
			<p>Although this project was fairly simple, I learned a lot about using these algorithms to solve real world problems. I hope to be able to apply this knowledge into a future project.</p>

			<h4>Textbook Marketplace</h4>
			<h6>For CS 3240 Advanced Software Development Methods</h6>
			<p>Link to our textbook marketplace app is <a href="http://textbook-finder.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			<p>Unlike most other CS classes, the goal of this class was to expose us to real-world software development processes rather than learning coding algorithms or computer architecture. Thus, the professor had us work on a semester-long team project using the Agile process of stand-ups and weekly sprints to at least get our feet wet using these processes. We were also required to use the Django web framework, push our code to GitHub, and deploy our application using Heroku's free deployment process.</p>
			<p>Our teams for this class were randomly assigned 6-person groups where each team member fulfilled a certain role. For example, I was the Scrum Master and my job was to ensure that our group was following the Agile methodology: having weekly stand-up meetings, noting what was finished and what was yet to be done, and assigning work for the next sprint. Other jobs included Testing Manager, who primarily wrote the tests for our app, and Software Architect, who created the design diagrams that explain what our app does.</p>
			<p>As the name suggests, this web application is designed to be an area for students to buy and sell used textbooks to save from having to spend too much money buying new or renting textbooks. We figured that having students buying from and selling to each other would be an efficient and cheap way to circulate certain commonly used books. It would also give a much more user-friendly interface than the Student to Student Textbooks Facebook Group.</p>
			<p>My work throughout the semester mostly revolved around the searching and filtering functionality and deploying the application to Heroku. I would also be the one to compile everyone's work at the end of the sprints to ensure we had something to demo in our lab sections. Initially, I had created some initial designs for some of the pages, but those were eventually overhauled at the end of the semester in favor of Boostrap components.</p>
			<p>Although I didn't learn much about software development processes since I already had exposure to Agile in my two prior internships, I learned a lot about creating a web app from the ground up. I'm actually using the ideas learned from this project in creating this website, using the django framework to create the pages and Heroku to deploy the site for free.</p>
