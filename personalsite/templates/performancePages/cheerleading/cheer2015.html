		<h2>Cheer 2015</h2>
		<p>My senior-year season was what definitely my strongest year, but also arguably the weakest years for the team. Over the past two years, I had been slowly learning how to tumble and, with the tumbling classes we had during the season, I was able to get more skills within a few weeks. Although I was not captain this year (our new coach preferring votes rather than appointment), I nonetheless was forced into a leadership role as Head Stuntman to help teach our new members. Our competition routine pushed me to my limits this year, making me rotate among tumbling, stunting, and jump sequences with little break time in between. Though exhausting to practice and run through, the routine made me feel accomplished, that I had grown from the guy who shows up and doesn't know what he's doing to someone whom everyone relies on.</p>
		<p>Here are some pictures my dad took of the season and some videos of our competition routine.</p>
