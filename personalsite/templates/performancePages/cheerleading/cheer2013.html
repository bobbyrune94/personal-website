		<h2>Cheer 2013</h2>
		<p>This was my first year on the cheerleading squad. My lab partner brought me in on the last day of tryouts and, after failing to learn anything in the hour that I had (and floundering about in front of the coaches) somehow made it to the varsity team. Then, after taking a 3-week vacation (one my family planned before my joining the team) and making marginal progress the following week in stunting, motions, and jumps, the coaches placed me on the competition squad. A series of very questionable decisions for sure, but evidently our coaches saw potential in me that I strove to meet. Even though I was the newbie, I pushed hard every day to make sure that I wasn't the one dragging the team down. Luckily, our team had many strong, experienced, and capable people to guide, support, and teach me all that I needed to know. Although I was my weakest and most clueless, our team was at its strongest. We placed 2nd of 8 in the Districts competition and advanced to Regionals, the only year in my career that we did. At Regionals, we placed 7th out of 12, just shy of advancing further, but we were still beyond satisfied with our performance.</p>
		<p>Here are some pictures my dad took throughout the season and some videos of our competition routine.</p>
